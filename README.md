Le-Lecteur is French for "The Reader" and this a project designed by us for our Web Programming Course. We have made use of all the skills we acquired during our course and inculcated them while designing this website. We have made use of HTML, CSS and Javascript for our frontend work. We have also used JSON and some modules of NodeJS such as hbs for creating handlebars, mongoose module for estaablishing database connectivity etc. 

We have also made use of a swiper-slider bundle that we found for creating our book sliders. We have two pages in our project; one being the main page and the other being a page which we designed specifically for buying and selling pre-owned books.

We have also created a seller form in our website where sellers can enter details for selling thier books. We established a database connectivity, using which we collected data from the seller form. We recorded this data into out MongoDB database.
